# audit_web_sdk

Build with `npm run build`

Test with `npm run test` (it will not rebuidl changed code, so I usually use `npm run build && npm run test` while developing)

This is published to the GitHub organization private registry. Build the project, copy package.json into the dist directory, then `cd dist` followed by `npm publish`

At some point we'll look at a proper publishing workflow but this so far is rarely updated.
